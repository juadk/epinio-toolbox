# k3s-epinio-1-node

The main purpose is to quickly pop up a cluster with Rancher installed inside to test Epinio installation on top of Rancher UI in the same cluster.

DISCLAIMER: This is not supported by Rancher, it's just for development and UI testing.

This Vagrantfile will deploy a k3s cluster with different tools you can configure in the [env.yml](./env.yml) file.
